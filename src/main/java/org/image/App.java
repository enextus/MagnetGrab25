/**
 * The App class serves as the main class for the "Magnet Opener" application, which is responsible for selecting,
 * reading, decoding, and displaying random images from a specified image directory. The class consists of the following components:
 * - Constants: LOGGER for logging, IMAGE_DIRECTORY for specifying the image directory, and RANDOM for generating random numbers.
 * - main method: The entry point of the application, which handles the image processing and display.
 * - getRandomImagePath method: Selects and returns a random image path from the specified directory.
 * - logURL method: Logs the provided URL.
 * - readResourceFileToString method: Reads a resource file and returns its content as a string.
 * - logSelectedImage method: Logs the path of the selected image.
 * The application reads image paths from a properties file (img.properties) within the specified directory, decodes Base64-encoded images,
 * and displays them in a window.
